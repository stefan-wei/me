          <p>Hi, My name is Stefan Wei and I am currently an undergraduate student
            majoring in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior (NPB)
            at the University of California, Davis. I am currently a premed student
            and I hope to enter medical school after I graduate college in 2022. I built this
            website as a side project during the Covid-19 quarantine after teaching
            myself HTML and CSS throughout the course of two weeks from
            <a href='https://internetingishard.com'>Interneting Is Hard</a>. This is
            mainly a proof of concept project for me as I try to apply everything I
            learned into this personal website. I'm planning on building a few more
            websites after I master the basics, with the end goal being able to create
            a website to help support the elderly and immuno-compromised people
            in my community here in Davis, CA.</p>
